# Custom Object Detection in Keras

This project implements a custom Keras object detection model with the ability to change the backbone.

## Description

The code in this project provides a custom implementation of an object detection model using Keras. The model architecture allows for flexibility in choosing the backbone network, which is an important component of the object detection pipeline.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. Prepare your dataset and annotations in the required format.
3. Modify the configuration file to specify the desired backbone network.
4. Train the model using the provided training script.
6. Use the trained model for object detection tasks by running the inference script.
